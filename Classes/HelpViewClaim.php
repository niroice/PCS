<h2 style="padding-top: 0; margin-top: 10; padding-bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 10;">About the View Claim page</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> This page allows authorised staff to view and access any claims within the Product Claim System. Options to view certain claim types and sort by criteria are provided to reduce the time in finding claims. A search options is also available for claim ID numbers. Additionally, one or more claim's status can be updated on this page by selecting a new claim status from the claim status drop-down menu and then clicking save at the bottom of the page to update the status. This reduces the need to open up each individual claim to just update a status. A notification panel at the top page is provided to inform the staff how many claims are still pending in the system, once a claim status has been changed to complete or cancelled it will no longer be flagged as outstanding by the system.</p>
